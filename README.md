Config files for my GitHub profile.

THE PROJECT WAS DONE FINISHED IN MAY 29th 2023, THIS IS JUST THE RECAP OF THE PROJECT

# ========== INTRODUCTION ==========

This repository contains code for Deep Learning AoL (Assessment of Learning) project on using few-shot learning to classify Chinese characters from the MNIST dataset. 
The project was not successful in achieving the desired results, but it is still a valuable learning experience.

# ========== MOTIVATION ==========

Few-shot learning is a machine learning technique that allows models to learn new tasks from just a few examples. This is a promising technique for many real-world problems, such as medical diagnosis and image classification.
Chinese characters are a challenging dataset for few-shot learning, because there are a large number of characters and they can be very similar to each other. 
Nevertheless, I was motivated to try to develop a few-shot learning model for Chinese character classification, because it would be a great experience to have.

# ========== APPROACH ==========

I used a variety of few-shot learning model and optimizer to classify Chinese characters. I didn't tried doing augmentation because it haven't crossed my mind at the time

# ========== RESULT ==========

Unfortunately, the model didn't achieve the desired results. There have been several error in the evaluation and the prediction, with the predicted accuracy reaching over 1500% and the predicted images with wrong class

# ========== LESSON LEARNED ==========

Despite the disappointing results, I learned a lot from this project. I learned about the challenges of few-shot learning and I gained experience with a variety of few-shot learning techniques. I also learned more about the MNIST Chinese character dataset.

# ========== FUTURE WORK ==========

I plan to continue improving my technique for few-shot learning and others deep learning project, especially image recognitions.

# ========== CONCLUSION ==========

This project was not successful in achieving the desired results, but it is still a valuable learning experience. I am grateful for the opportunity to have worked on this project and I look forward to continuing my work in this area.
